Project Description Using data collected from the State of Iowa, I will apply the data wrangling and visualization skills I learned in Introduction to the Tidyverse.  I will group, summarize, and visualize data on breath alcohol tests in Ames, Iowa, (home of Iowa State University) from 2013-2017.  Some questions I will answer include, "What is the highest recorded value?" and "When do breath alcohol tests occur most?"
