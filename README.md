# Who is drunk and when in Ames, Iowa?
Project Description 

This is a Datacamp project that I did to get my hands on with data manipulation and visulization in R.

Using data collected from the State of Iowa, I will apply the data wrangling and visualization skills I learned in Introduction to the Tidyverse.  

I will group, summarize, and visualize data on breath alcohol tests in Ames, Iowa, (home of Iowa State University) from 2013-2017.  

Some questions answered include, "What is the highest recorded value?" and "When do breath alcohol tests occur most?"
